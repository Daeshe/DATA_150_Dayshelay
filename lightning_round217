# What is development?

How do we expand on the freedoms and quality of life for individuals? How does opportunity come about? Development, both technologically and governmentally, allows young nations to offer opportunities to its people. (Fair trade corporations) However, greater opportunity can also make way for the loss of other freedoms--the ability to gain power quickly.

# Is this definition of development an expansive or narrower view?

Amartya Sen's definition is rather expansive. This is due to its vague nature, which is a quality that all general definitions possess. In order to fit many cases, it must be versatile and not eliminate too many instances through means of specificity. Here, we Sen uses the definition of freedom, both what it is and what it is not, to characterize development.

# What are some of the sources of unfreedoms development requires to be removed?

In many cases, unfreedom is defined by a lack of political mobility to the masses, upon which there is a greater emphasis on government control. Often, this leads to a much harsher political system and the absence of democratic and political rights. The presence of a more authoritarian state allows for a more streamlined methodology when solving issues. This can also precipitate a more unified approach or appeal. On the more extreme part of the spectrum, freedom of speech may be limited. (Consider freedom of choice and child slavery)

# Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?

Sustainability is akin to consistency and therefore stability. For example, if there is no sustainable access to water for a group of individuals, they are unable to prosper in other areas. This can be used as a general rule for opportunity--If the opportunity is not provided for a group to meet a specific need, they will suffer in that area and be incapable of prospering elsewhere. This is also an indicator of communication between leadership and its constituents, or at the very least, the ability of those in power to detect and meet the needs of the people. 

# What does Sen say about being "generically against" markets?

He finds it odd. It's as unnatural as a lack of freedom of speech. After all, a market economy has little-to-no governmental control and a nearly ideal level of freedom. It allows for a robust economy; every opportunity is open. Sen is able to view the positive side of markets, even if there are resulting misdeeds which he compares to negative conversations.

# What was the story of Kader Mia? What was the penalty of his economic unfreedom?

Kader Mia was a Muslim man who was forced to work in a predominately Hindu area whilst heavy conflict ensued between followers of Islam and Hinduism. This man simply could not afford to live without a job and he was unable to find work elsewhere. He was stabbed on his way to work, for which he would receive little pay, and fell into the yard of a young Amartya Sen. After being escorted to the hospital, he succumbed to his injuries. After much pondering, Sen comes to the conclusion that Kader Mia would not have experienced harm if he had been economically stable.

# Who were Condorcet and Malthus? What were their primary arguments regarding development and fertility?

Condorcet argued that fertility rates would lower as "reasoning", meaning the average level of education, grew. He believed that there would be greater security and more freedom, therefore restraining population growth. Malthus argued for the absence of causation. He believed that wealth was the deciding factor in fertility rates; nothing, save for a lack of resources, would hinder individuals from marrying early and subsequently birthing more children. Amartya Sen states that his argument lies more heavily with Condercet.
