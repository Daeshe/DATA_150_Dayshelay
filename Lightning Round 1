# What is development?

How do we expand on the freedoms and quality of life for individuals? How does opportunity come about? Development, both technologically and governmentally, allows young nations to offer opportunities to its people. (Fair trade corporations) However, greater opportunity can also make way for the loss of other freedoms--the ability to gain power quickly.

# Is this definition of development an expansive or narrower view?

Amartya Sen's definition is rather expansive. This is due to its vague nature, which is a quality that all general definitions possess. In order to fit many cases, it must be versatile and not eliminate too many instances through means of specificity. Here, we Sen uses the definition of freedom, both what it is and what it is not, to characterize development.

# What are some of the sources of unfreedoms development requires to be removed?

In many cases, unfreedom is defined by a lack of political mobility to the masses, upon which there is a greater emphasis on government control. Often, this leads to a much harsher political system and the absence of democratic and political rights. The presence of a more authoritarian state allows for a more streamlined methodology when solving issues. This can also precipitate a more unified approach or appeal. On the more extreme part of the spectrum, freedom of speech may be limited. (Consider freedom of choice and child slavery)

# Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?

Sustainability is akin to consistency and therefore stability. For example, if there is no sustainable access to water for a group of individuals, they are unable to prosper in other areas. This can be used as a general rule for opportunity--If the opportunity is not provided for a group to meet a specific need, they will suffer in that area and be incapable of prospering elsewhere. This is also an indicator of communication between leadership and its constituents, or at the very least, the ability of those in power to detect and meet the needs of the people. 

# What does Sen say about being "generically against" markets?

He finds it odd. It's as unnatural as a lack of freedom of speech.
