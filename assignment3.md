Tropical locations are some of the most vulnerable locations on the planet due to the heavy presence of agriculture. While the agricultural industry provides most local communities with the resources they need to survive, further encouraging their sparse amount of interdependence, it perpetuates the influence of large corporations.  Many of these locations are driven to specialization, specifically in the area of palm oil. While this relationship is prominent in the economic culture of tropical nations, it is greatly unexplored in the scientific field. The situation yields a possible research question: How does the conversion of tropical land and subsequent management of palm oil plantations contribute to global warming and climate change? Sub-inquiries arise from this broad question. For instance, how does agricultural land use contribute to significant climatological events and global climatological change; what is the relationship between the wealth of the locals and deforestation; how does the deforestation resulting from palm oil production contribute to climate events; does the economic success of the palm oil industry as a whole contribute to the fluctuation and/or stability of local tropical economies? One notable variable is the output of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc, as these values would serve as an indicator of climatological distress. Additional variables include the earnings of palm oil plantations as well as the harvest yield from plantations.

This research question lends itself to the structure of both the causal/predictive puzzle and the explanatory question.  It is worth noting that this question can also fit into the classification of a mechanical puzzle, the purpose of which is to discern the manner in which a process occurs and the factors that contribute to its functioning.  A causal/predictive puzzle seeks to discover the correlation between two variables and possible causation from one factor to another; this falls further along the quantitative spectrum than the definition of an explanatory question experimental spectrum. The purpose of an explanatory inquiry is to define the reasoning behind a certain anomaly, scenario, or problem, and further dissect the process or processes surrounding the situation in an attempt to understand both “the why” and “the how” of the system or systems in place.

## The Relationship Between Land Surface and Climate

The first study utilizes data from general circulation models to understand the relationship between land surface and climate.  This addresses the first sub-inquiry belonging to the greater question. A general circulation model is a 3D computer model of the global climate system that portray a connection between the atmosphere, bodies of water, and land coverage. Latitudinal and longitudinal data play a crucial role as these models rely heavily on grids, which often range from 1-5 degrees in either respect. Newer models take into account the hydrologic cycle, specifically its direct relationship with and explicit representation within the vegetative canopies located within the tropical latitudes. These plant canopies have been proven to have an effect on both energy transfer and water fluxes. General circulation models simulate the potential climactic consequences of deforestation on the regional scale in the respective areas of the Amazon basin, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia as well as the consequences presented by both pantropical and global deforestation. The authors gathered variables from CIFOR’s GCS household surveys.  Any local currencies were converted to USD to maintain a standard value. This was based on the June 1, 2010 spot exchange rate. Data for tropical rainfall was gathered using the Global Precipitation Measurement Satellite. Observational data from the Amazon was used to demonstrate the effect on deforestation on agriculture. This data was compared with models from Central Africa and Southeast Asia. (Andersson, et al., 2018)

The researchers state that an intercomparison project would be helpful to increase the scientific community’s understanding of how various occurrences and the models themselves contribute to, exacerbate or mitigate the changes produced by deforestation. In more specific terms, this would be useful in differentiating the effects of local climatological drivers from regional or global climate drivers. These prove to be confounding variables as the rate of deforestation has increased along with natural regional oscillations.

The above model displays the locations that experience varying effects on their respective climates as a result of deforestation.  Circular marks are an indicator of increasing precipitation. Triangles are an indicator of decreasing precipitation.  Red values are representative of areas that resulted from complete deforestation in the Amazon. Yellow values are representative of areas that resulted from complete deforestation in Africa. Blue values are representative of values resulting from complete deforestation in Southeast Asia. Data was compiled from several sources and organized by corresponding numerical values. (Andersson, et al., 2018)

##  The Financial Impact of Carbon Reduction

The second study focused on the potential relationship between the actions of REDD+ and the distribution of wealth in tropical nations.  This addresses the greater financial element of the larger research inquiry. The authors utilized survey data collected on a household level. The sample size included a total of 130 villages in six countries.  These villages encompassed a total of 3239 villages.  They used baseline data from an ongoing study of REDD+ initiatives.  These initiatives included joint distribution of household wealth, income generated by forests, and income originating from external sources, including programs instituted by the government. Data was collected using multiple approaches, one of which included a survey of 30 households that were randomly selected. This allowed the data to be evenly distributed and accurately represent the population. (Lawrence & Vandecar, 2015)

One of the goals of this study was to predict the future distribution of forest benefits; as a formal term, “forest benefits” is broadly defined, including both explicit financial gain as well as externalities that may be attributed to ecosystem services and other implicit factors such as perceived tenure security. Regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between assets, tenure security, and flows of income, all of which acted as dependent variables. The form of said regression was hierarchical and multilevel to account for correlation and heterogeny across varying locations, both locally and nationally.

The above graphs display the relationship between the assets possessed by a household, plotted on the x-axis, and the possible land claims of a household, plotted on the y-axis. The households are grouped by their respective nations. The researchers determined that the results could potentially contain endogenous factors, meaning the independent variable was correlated with an additional variable that was not being tested, and therefore did not conclude causality. (Lawrence & Vandecar, 2015)

As emphasized by the authors of each study, the results obtained can, and should, be further clarified by exploring the relationships between variables not accounted for in their data collection and statistical analysis. It is necessary to solidify these pillars before performing further modeling or statistical analysis, as they would contribute to the greater question.  There appear to be no substantial gaps in the realm of sampling. However, the second study has not yet reached predictive capacity, not for lack of data, but for lack of clarification. The first study, which relates land use to climate change, in part addresses the relationship between deforestation and climate change. The second study, which tests the relationship between the economic value generated by forests and household income, addresses the preexisting economic culture within tropical landscapes. It would be advantageous to consider the variables such as the rate of deforestation as well as the presence of additional external forces besides government programs, rather considering the presence of palm oil corporations such as Nestle.
