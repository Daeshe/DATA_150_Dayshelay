First world countries import copious amounts of palm oil each year to generate many of their most commonly consumed products. The indigenous people that cultivate the plantations are called “smallholders”. More traditional farmers tend to operate independent of larger corporations or are tied to companies that practice fair trade, which ensures that individuals are properly compensated for their work. A second grouping of farmers includes those who travel to farm rather than remaining stationary. This means these individuals do not contribute substantially to any economy due to a lack of stability. However, a study conducted in 2021 discovered that migrant workers held more palm oil plots than the non-transient population.

Palm oil plantations are typically utilized as a way to strengthen the economy present in a community. Those that had a previously existing dependence on subsistence farming, a form of agriculture in which a family produces the goods they require to survive without much surplus, predominately saw social and environmental elements skew negatively. They lost access to many resources indicative of positive wellbeing, such as electricity, energy, and adequate sanitation. However, the quality of life in these villages increased after anywhere from 11 to 14 years upon which the profits from palm oil plantations had begun to solidify a long-standing presence in the economy. Communities that previously housed a market economy reaped positive effects for the first ten years, leading to improved infrastructure. These changes included greater access to improvements in education as well as greater access to healthcare. Villages that were located near palm oil plantations from the years 2000 to 2014 faced severe social and economic degradation. Social degradation can be attributed to an inadequate distribution of funds, the majority going to corporations. In a 2012 survey, 45% of the family members included in the sample stated that they supplemented palm oil production with other forms of income. Palm oil production accounted for 61% of total family income on average. However, data collected from Sumatra displayed a greater range, generating values from 63% to 78%, signifying that palm oil may play a larger economic role in this region. Locations in Kalimantan displayed the opposite effect; surveys generated values from 31% to 61%. Generally, the economic effects of palm oil can be clustered. This is a result of different households being in possession of varied levels of resources. This includes funds to invest, adequate labor, and land to farm on. The tropical economy is heavily reliant on agricultural exports. The most prevalent of these, and potentially the most lucrative, is palm oil. 

Due to the steady temperature and the proximity of tropical locations to the equator, the majority of crops grown are exclusive to these latitudes. Tropical latitudes experience both a dry season and a wet season. As climate change continues to worsen, these seasons fluctuate in length and intensity, making it increasingly difficult to care for and sustain a profitable yield for tropical crops. In order to transition and prepare land to house crops, farmers use a technique known as “slash and burn” agriculture. This process entails chopping down any existing vegetation, whether that be domesticated crops or naturally occurring vegetation. Then, the plot of land intended to be used for farming is set on fire to rid it of any remaining debris.
This process releases a large amount of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide, resulting in an increase in global warming.

Tropical environments are home to the most robust rainforests on the planet.  These rainforests are known as plant canopies, which cover large amounts of land. They also absorb copious amounts of carbon dioxide and prove to be a remedying factor in relation to global warming. When palm oil plantations replace existing land, especially land that was previously occupied by natural vegetation, this modifies the amount of carbon that is able to be fixed and withheld from the atmosphere. As palm oil trees are smaller than the plant canopies that existed for centuries before them, they are less efficient at absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, further contributing to global warming.	Palm oil plantations also produce a greenhouse gas known as nitrous oxide. The agriculture industry is responsible for up to 85% of total nitrous oxide emissions. This is due to the usage of nitrogen-rich fertilizers as well as those rich in organic compounds. The emission of nitrous oxide is exacerbated by the warm climate present in tropical regions, further contributing global warming and climate change.

With the addition of palm oil plantations, many communities lose access to valuable ecosystem services. Palm oil plantations fail to provide similar carbon fixation to the preceding vegetation, soil maintenance, contribute to ecotourism, all of which ease the development process in a way that aids human civilization. The palm oil industry also contributes to deforestation on a major scale. This leads to the destruction of one of the most crucial ecosystem services to communities that live near water—A riparian buffer typically occurs naturally, but can also be engineered by man; they hold sediment in place and prevent erosion. The lack of proper soil maintenance on the part of palm oil plantations allows for massive erosion. This is also a product of deforestation from the same industry.  Freshly cleared land has an erosion rate that is nearly ten times the size of that belonging to an established palm oil plantation, averaging about 950 t ha-1y-1. The amount of sediment found in waterways running throughout palm oil plantations can be anywhere from 2 to 8 times larger than the samples taken from further upstream where naturally occurring vegetation was present.  Furthermore, these loads of sediment are writhe with the pesticides and herbicides utilized in mainstream agriculture. Contamination can also originate from nitrogen fertilizers.  All of these factors can greatly contribute to the worsened quality of drinking water.

The complexity of the issue at hand presents the following question: How does the conversion of tropical land and subsequent management of palm oil plantations contribute to global warming and climate change? This isolates the direct effect of first world countries, the demand for greater product, and therefore greater land use, while acknowledging the gravity of an issue such as climate change. Current literature does not acknowledge the indirect effect first world countries have on climate change. This issue would not exist if not for demand originating from outside forces. It is necessary to dissect the nature of the relationship between the economy in first world countries, the tropics, and greenhouse gas production to then discover alternatives that provide more stability for the developing nations involved.

A potential null hypothesis would read as follows: “The carbon output in locations with naturally occurring vegetation is greater than or equal to the carbon output in locations converted for palm oil agriculture.” A potential alternative hypothesis would read as follows: “The carbon output in locations with naturally occurring vegetation is less than the carbon output in locations converted for palm oil agriculture." This set of hypotheses addresses the causal/predictive puzzle presented by the research question by seeking to address a correlation between land use and carbon output. A second set of hypotheses would address that of an explanatory inquiry, which seeks to understand both “the why” and “the how” of a select system or systems. A possible null hypothesis would be: “There is no correlation between palm oil consumption and carbon output.” A possible alternative hypothesis would be: “There is a correlation between palm oil consumption and carbon output.”	The first set of hypotheses would require a measure of land use. Therefore, this would require surveying of populations in tropical nations. The greatest amount of data would precipitate from families reporting how much land they utilize to farm and/or the crops grown on said land. Indonesia would be the most ideal location as it possesses the palm oil industry is ingrained very deeply into its economy, functioning on a large scale. Satellite data could be used as a supplementary tool. This could also allow for the usage of general circulation models, portraying a multitude of climatological outcomes. General circulation models could be used as a means of displaying the gravity of climate change. For example, it could convey the modification and possible intensification of storm patterns, which are generated by warm and cold fronts colliding.

The first portion of the study would include compiling and organizing previously gathered data from reputable sources, as to ensure that any algorithm has more than enough data points to produce realistic and plausible results. This may include climate data, data on land use (particularly that of an agricultural nature), as well as data concerning the consumption of palm oil and/or the profits generated by companies that harvest palm oil on mass. Secondly, a the generation of a survey that analyzes both land use and other costs of living associated with palm oil plantations. Third, it would be necessary to gather data on the current division of land.  This would require surveys to be dispersed across a general population of at least a group of 30 landowners. It is ideal that the sample size be much larger than this, and dispersed across a wide variety of locations to prevent clustering, ill-informed assumptions, and failure in the statistical process. Fourth, current samples of carbon output should be collected, preferably from similar locations to the previously collected data. Finally, the carbon output should be compared over the course of several periods of time to determine if either hypothesis is statistically sound.

This study could be used to spur progress, specifically in the realm of land use and, by extension, human exploitation. While social progress is necessary, political change is necessary in order to modify the way corporations from more economically stable countries interact with tropical nations and their fragile financial states. In the realm of research and academia, this study could also be used as a foundation and/or talking point for the argument of climate change. This could be a crucial to the way the human race regards our business ventures and their dependency on the environment.
