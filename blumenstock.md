#Blumenstock Response

Blumenstock leads his audience in with a strong usage of logos, a hopeful view of the age of information. Then, he strings his audience together in the one way they can all be connected--technology.

He continues on with a theme of hope, depicting how large bodies such as the UN and World Band are seeking to hire data scientists. He talks about the leaps and bounds made in the technological sphere: Over the course of nearly two decades, the number of individuals owning a mobile device worldwide has increased exponentially.

With a pocket-sized device constantly harvesting data, the resulting graphs and/or maps have the potential to change how the world, primarily developed countries, remedies global issues and distributes humanitarian aid.

From there, Blumenstock proceeds to discuss the possible disadvantageous of pursuing such an ambitious humanitarian feat.

With any deed, no matter the intention, comes externalies. Blumenstock states that many of these externalities would originate from the project's intended parent--big data.

While many humanitarian propositions seem like 

##What really is a humbler form of data science?

Blumenstock states that initiatives that attempted to achieve this ideal, such as the one-laptop per child initiative failed. He blames this on the ineptitude of data scientists to be aware of the social/cultural environment surrounding them.

I find this to be a widespread phenomena throughout the scientific community as a whole. As individuals become more educated, they learn new methods to express themselves. With these methods comes jargon that is only decipherable by the scientific community. For example, consider the field of statistics, where expertise means nothing until one understands the value of a confidence interval, r-squared value, p-value, z-test, t-test, etc.

Blumenstock emphasizes increased transparency as a solution. In order to achieve this, data, or information in general, must be digestable. Therefore, more educated individuals, those who harbor influence, are incapable of filtering information distributed to the masses.

I would liken this to Gutenburg's printing press.
